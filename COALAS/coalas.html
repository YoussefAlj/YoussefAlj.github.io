<h1>COALAS project:</h1>
<h2> Introduction:</h2>

<p>The COALAS project (Cognitive Assisted Living Ambient System) aims to develop an autonomous cognitive platform, combining efficient wheelchair navigation and assistive 
capabilities of a humanoid robot. 
<p>My work consists in conception, implementation and evaluation of a visual navigation system on a wheelchair equipped with an omnidirectional camera.
</p>
<p>The proposed visual navigation method is based on visual path following technique :
<ul>
<li>The first step consists in acquiring a set of key images used as a visual memory during the second step.</li>
<li>Using the visual memory of the first step, we perform successive visual servoings by considering each key image as a temporary target that we aim to reach.</li>
</ul>
